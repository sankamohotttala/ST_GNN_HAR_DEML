# Project Directory Overview

This README provides a brief description of the files and directories included in this project.

## 📁 Directories

- **graph/**  
  Contains graph-related data structures, adjacency matrices, or utilities used for processing graph inputs.

- **model/**  
  Stores trained models, model architecture definitions, or saved checkpoints for inference or fine-tuning.

- **results/**  
  Includes evaluation outputs, predictions, and performance metrics generated after model testing or validation.

## 📄 Python Scripts

- **get_statistics.py**  
  Script to compute various performance statistics such as accuracy, precision, recall, or other custom metrics.

- **main_test.py**  
  Main testing script for evaluating the model using a predefined dataset split (likely train/test or validation).

- **main_test_LOOCV.py**  
  Variant of the test script implementing Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV) for performance evaluation.

- **main_test_newProto_random.py**  
  Another test variation using a new prototype-based random sampling method, possibly for few-shot or prototypical learning tasks.

- **utility_custom.py**  
  Contains custom utility functions used across scripts such as data loading, preprocessing, or helper functions.
