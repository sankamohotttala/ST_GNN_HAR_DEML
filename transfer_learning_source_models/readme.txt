F:\Codes\joint attention\2022\NTU_train_for_20\logs\STGCN_NEW_22 -ntu22 -agree with top5 (epoch) but not with top1 top1 in paper is 89.59 but in the event file,it is 89.67 -could have been a mistaken in paper - given 29 epoch weight is saved [save freq =5;29 is saved since code read it as 30th]

F:\Codes\joint attention\2022\NTU_train_for_20\logs\NEW_60 - ntu60 top1 agree (epoch 14) but not top5 - top5 is 93.38 but journal is 92.13 - not sure why probably mistakenly added in paper
