[above contains model codes developed for HAR using the sliding window approach. It also contains the other plot/image creation related codes]
[F:\Codes\joint attention\2022 Integratiom - this base folder was created several years ago when CAR model intergration was attempted with streaming data [real-time] - but that attempt was unsuccesful. Since CVIU reviewers asked for streaming data experiments, we restarted the attempt in the same folder]
